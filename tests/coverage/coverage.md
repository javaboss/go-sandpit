#Coverage

Coverage in programming is how much of our code is covered by tests. We can use the “-cover” flag to run coverage analysis on our code. We can use the flag and required file name “-coverprofile <some file name>” to write our coverage analysis to a file.

code: 

go test -cover

go test -coverprofile c.out

show in browser:

(need to create the c.out file first - see commands above!)
go tool cover -html=c.out

go tool cover -h
